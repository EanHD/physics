# Feature Specification: Build a beginner-friendly quantum mechanics study app

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-beginner`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a beginner-friendly quantum mechanics study app guided by speckit"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
	‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
	‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
	‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
	‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
	‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
	‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
	‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
	‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
	- User types and permissions
	- Data retention/deletion policies  
	- Performance targets and scale
	- Error handling behaviors
	- Integration requirements
	- Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a beginner in physics, I want a guided learning app that takes me from minimal mathematical background to a working understanding of undergraduate quantum mechanics so I can follow standard courses and solve introductory problems.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user with limited math background, **When** they choose the "Beginner ‚Üí Quantum" learning path, **Then** the app presents a recommended study plan that includes prerequisite math modules, lessons, and weekly goals.
2. **Given** a user finishes a module, **When** they complete the module quiz, **Then** the app records progress and schedules spaced review sessions for forgotten concepts.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user already knows some prerequisites? ‚Üí The app MUST support skipping modules and re-adjusting the plan.
- How does the system handle incomplete quiz submissions? ‚Üí Partial progress must be saved and the user prompted to finish.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST present a structured learning path from foundational math to quantum mechanics, broken into modules.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to take short lessons (text + optional video links) and complete short quizzes at the end of each module.
- **FR-003**: System MUST track user progress (completed modules, quiz scores, last accessed date) and persist it.
- **FR-004**: System MUST recommend prerequisite modules when the user selects an advanced topic.
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement a spaced repetition scheduling placeholder (SM-2 or similar) to schedule reviews.
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to mark modules as skipped or completed manually.
- **FR-007**: System MUST surface external resource links (from `study_resources.md`) next to relevant modules and respect licensing (link only where redistribution is not allowed).
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a simple search over module titles, resource names, and key concepts.
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow content admins (developer/local user) to add or update modules via a file-based content format (e.g., Markdown) stored in the repo.

*Marked unclear requirements:*
- **FR-010**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - local accounts, OAuth, or none?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST persist user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention policy unspecified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **UserProfile**: Represents the learner; attributes: username, email [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: optional], completedModules[], progressState, preferences
- **Module**: Title, description, estimatedTime, prerequisites[], contentPath (Markdown or link), exercises[], tags
- **Quiz**: moduleId, questions[], passingScore, attempts
- **Resource**: name, description, link, category (from `study_resources.md`)
- **ScheduleEntry**: userId, moduleId, reviewDate, interval
