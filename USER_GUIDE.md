## 🎯 How to Use Your App

### Step 1: Start the App
```bash
cd /home/eanhd/projects/physics
npm run dev
```
Then open: http://localhost:5173

### Step 2: Try These Features
1. **Browse Modules**: Click "Browse Modules" to see all topics
2. **Start Learning**: Click any module to start reading
3. **Take Quizzes**: Complete a module to unlock its quiz
4. **Check Progress**: Visit the Progress page to see your stats
5. **Toggle Theme**: Click the theme button in the top navigation
6. **Export Data**: Go to Settings → Export Progress
7. **Install App**: Go to Settings → Install as App

### Step 3: Test the Smart Learning
1. Complete a module (it will schedule a review)
2. Come back tomorrow and see it appear in "Reviews"
3. Your study streak will grow as you use it daily

## 🏁 Final Steps (You Do These)

### Option A: Use It Locally (Easiest)
- Just run `npm run dev` whenever you want to study
- Your progress saves automatically in your browser

### Option B: Deploy to GitHub Pages (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to Settings > Pages
3. Choose "GitHub Actions" as source
4. Your app will be live at: `https://yourusername.github.io/physics`

### Option C: Deploy Anywhere
```bash
npm run build
# Upload the dist/ folder to any web hosting service
```

## 📱 Install as Mobile App

**On Chrome/Edge:**
1. Click the install button (⬇️) in the address bar
